### Set Up to Authenticate With Your Project's Credentials
In order to try out this sample, visit the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), and
navigate to:
`API Manager > Credentials > Create credentials > Service account key > New service account`.
Create a new service account, and download the JSON credentials file. Put the file in the app
resources as `app/src/main/res/raw/credential.json`.

Again, ***you should not do this in your production app.***

See the [Cloud Platform Auth Guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication#developer_workflow)
for more information.
